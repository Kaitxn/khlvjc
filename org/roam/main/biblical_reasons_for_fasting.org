* Fasting

** Humility
When we [[id:6a6c667b-a9d0-4ce1-a6b6-9143b4fdfe88][fast]], we offer up our pleasures as a pleasing *sacrifice* to the LORD. *Denying the flesh*, we humble ourselves before God as a subservient, and faithful servant. Relying on him for strength, we feel how weak and powerless we are, reminding us to make *Christ our strength and power*.

*** Verses relating to fasting and humility

** Jesus's expectation
Jesus expected us to fast, as recorded in [[https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-6-16_6-18/][Matthew 6:16-18]]. Jesus himself fasted for [[https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-Chapter-4/][40 days and 40 nights]], so as followers of Jesus, we are to follow in his footsteps.
